# xcube-cds

An [xcube plugin](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html)
which can generate data cubes from the
[Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) API](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to).

Currently, only one dataset is supported:
[ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1979 to present](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview).
